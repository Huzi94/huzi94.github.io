#Some Intro...

Hello and welcome to my blog! I have built this blog to practice my writing skills and to share some thoughts on programming.

I am a great fan of the open source community and one of my goals in life is to contribute as much as I can to the open source community. Currently, I have an intermediate knowledge about programming and can only write basic programs. I am a self-taught programmer, mostly learning from books and from studying open source code. I have just finished high school and I have plenty of time before Uni, so I am utilizing this time to learn more about programming.

It is said that we achieve excellence by learning from more experienced and successful people so, I would like to end this post by asking a question: 

#The Question...
