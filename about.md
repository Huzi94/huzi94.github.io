  Jambo and hello there! I am Huzeifa from the beautiful island of Mombasa. I study electrical and electronics engineering at the University of Nairobi.

My interests include embedded systems, IoT, circuit design, computer programming, machine learning and mathematics.

I am an outdoor person who enjoys swimming in the sea, cycling and going for long walks.
