Learning Qucs: Simulation of a constant current source using a BJT.

Circuit simulation is a very important skill to acquire, since it aids in verifying circuit designs and helps you to master ciruit analysis.

In this post, I will show you how to use Qucs to perform a simulation of a simple current source employing BJTs and diodes.

-What is Qucs?
Qucs is an opensource circuit simulation software with a graphical user interface. It can be used to perform several types of simulations such as DC, AC, S-parameter, Harmonic Balance analysis, noise analysis and transient analysis. Qucs provides all the standard lumped components together with many semiconductor based devices and models such as opamps, diodes, MOSFETs, PMOSFETs and many more. In addition, digital simulation can also be performed in Qucs.

-Installing Qucs
Qucs is fairly easy to install and is available on major Linux based operating systems such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, etc. Qucs is also available on Windows and Mac OS. Please visit this page to learn more about installing Qucs: page name.

Ubuntu users should do a simple sudo apt-get install qucs, and Fedora users should punch in sudo dnf install qucs.

Once Qucs has been successfully installed on your machine, launch it using the OS program menu or simply type qucs in the terminal and hit Enter.

-Exploring the Qucs Environment
Qucs is easy to use once you have a firm grasp of the interface. I suggest you take a few minutes to explore the interface in order to familiarize yourself with the program. You can obtain a description of an icon or menu by simply hovering the mouse pointer over it.

For this tutorial, I have briefly outlined the key things you need to know about the interface.
